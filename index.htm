  <p>Today has been fine, I am getting a pet rock. Just for fun something I can rant at. It even comes with a booklet on how to take care of it. I wonder if every image is just the same rock, that would be funny. It is
    going to arrive in a couple of days. And tomorrow we are going to have steak to eat for dinner. I love steak!</p>
  <br></br>

<p>Tonight we are having steak and god I hope this will be the best ever. And I am re playing a half life mod called they hunger, its good. I may make a video about it on my youtube channel.
The pet rock will come on the upcoming Tuesday and today is Thursday. And Saturday or Sunday I forgot is fathers day. My dad is a good dad! I should make a website deticated to him.</p>
